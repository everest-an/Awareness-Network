# Privacy Policy for Awareness Network

**Last Updated:** October 30, 2025

Welcome to Awareness Network ("we," "our," or "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our mobile application (the "App").

## 1. The Core of Our Privacy: Zero-Knowledge

Awareness Network is built on a **zero-knowledge architecture**. This means we have no ability to access, view, or decrypt the content you store in our App. All your memories, contacts, and notes are encrypted on your device before they are uploaded to our servers. The key to decrypt your data is stored only on your device and is controlled entirely by you.

## 2. Information We Do Not Collect

We **do not** collect, store, or have access to:

- The content of your memories (photos, messages, notes).
- Your personal contacts or business card information.
- Your decryption keys.

## 3. Information We Do Collect

To provide our service, we collect a limited amount of information:

- **Account Information**: When you create an account, we collect your email address and a hashed version of your password. This is used for authentication purposes only.
- **Usage Metadata**: We may collect anonymous, aggregated usage data to help us improve our App. This data does not contain any personal information and cannot be linked to your account. For example, we may track how many users use a certain feature, but not who used it.
- **Device Information**: We may collect non-personal information about your device, such as the operating system version, to help us troubleshoot bugs and improve compatibility.

## 4. How We Use Your Information

The limited information we collect is used solely to:

- Provide, maintain, and improve our services.
- Authenticate your account.
- Communicate with you about your account or our services.
- Troubleshoot technical issues.

## 5. Data Storage

Your encrypted data is stored on secure cloud servers. We repeat: this data is fully encrypted, and we do not have the keys to decrypt it.

## 6. Data Sharing

We do not share, sell, or rent your personal information or encrypted content with any third parties. Period.

We may only disclose information if required to do so by law, but even then, we can only provide the encrypted data, which we cannot decrypt.

## 7. Your Rights and Controls

You have full control over your data. You can:

- Access, edit, and delete your memories within the App at any time.
- Export your data.
- Delete your account. Deleting your account will permanently remove all your data from our servers.

## 8. Security

We use industry-standard security measures to protect the limited information we store. Your content is protected by the end-to-end encryption you control.

## 9. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy in the App and updating the "Last Updated" date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.
